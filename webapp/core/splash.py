"""The module-opening splash — deliberately client-side.

⚠️ READ THIS BEFORE REPLACING IT WITH SOMETHING THAT LOOKS TIDIER IN PYTHON.

Three server-side versions were built and all three failed, for one reason:
Streamlit only swaps the visible page when a script run CONCLUDES. Going from
the landing page to a module (or back) changes the whole script path, and for
the entire duration of that run the browser keeps showing the page it already
had.

  · a placeholder filled then cleared inside one run  — never painted at all
  · st.rerun() to force a splash-only frame           — the abandoned run left
                                                        the old page's own
                                                        elements behind
  · st.spinner() around the load                      — DOES flush mid-run, but
                                                        only ~480 ms in, and it
                                                        paints OVER the still
                                                        visible old page, which
                                                        then survives into the
                                                        half-drawn destination

So the overlay is put up by the browser, on the click itself, with no server
round trip in between — which is the only way "the moment I click" can
actually mean that. Python's only job is to take it down again, once the
destination has finished rendering.

Same-origin: a components.html iframe can reach window.parent.document, and
the overlay is appended to the parent's <body>, outside Streamlit's managed
element tree — so Streamlit will neither prune it early nor fight over it.

Three ways to raise the SAME overlay, for the three ways a visitor arrives
somewhere in this app, plus two ways to take it back down:
    arm()          + dismiss()          landing → a module (tile click)
    arm_home()     + dismiss_landing()  a module → landing ("← All modules")
    cold_start()   + dismiss_landing()  nobody  → landing  (first page load)
The first two are click-armed: something is clicked, and the click itself
(not the Python rerun it triggers) puts the overlay up. The third has no
click to hook — a first-ever visit is the one arrival with no earlier page to
have been clicked FROM — so cold_start() raises it directly, as the first
thing the landing render does.

dismiss() (used leaving a module) removes the overlay as fast as the
destination's own first paint allows, because a module should feel snappy to
open. dismiss_landing() (used arriving at the landing page, from either of
the other two) deliberately holds it a little longer and then restarts the
landing page's own entry animation from a clean start — see LAND_DISMISS_JS —
so that animation always plays out in full on a page the visitor can actually
see, rather than partway, hidden, while racing whatever put the cover up.
