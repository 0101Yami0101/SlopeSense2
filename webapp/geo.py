"""Place search + browser geolocation — Streamlit-free so it can be tested.

Two jobs:

1. Build ONE searchable index of everywhere a user might want a forecast:
   4,648 settlements, 18 districts, and any latitude/longitude they type in.
   This replaces the old "Jump to" dropdown, which only browsed towns and had
   no way to reach a specific coordinate.

2. Ask the browser where the user is, so the Forecast page opens on their own
   location instead of a statewide average nobody lives at.

⚠️ Geolocation is deliberately NOT a Python dependency. The browser owns the
answer, so the request runs as a tiny script that writes the result into the
page's query string and reloads. That keeps the deploy at seven pure-Python
packages, which is what lets it run on a free host.
